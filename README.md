**Crypto Bot v1.2** is a running on Coinbase Pro designed to automate the buying and selling of cryptocurriences in order to maximize profit and minimize loss.

It identifies bull and bear markets through the golden cross and death cross using the Simple Moving Average SMA 50 and SMA 200. This first level of filtering favors only buying possision on the incline.

The bot also uses the Average True Range (ATR) to determine volatility in the market. The ATR is calculated over a 14 candles and can help us predict how much a crypto is expected to move. The ATR is also used to determine the stop loss to minimize loss.

When MACD crosses the signal line from bottom to top a buy is triggered and a stop loss is placed. Likewise when the MACD crosses the signal line from top to bottom sell ordersstop losses are canceled and sell orders are placed.

This bot also compares the EMA of the hour chart vs the 6 hour chart in order to determine how bullish it is. A very bullish market will trade on 15min candles instead of hour candles.

## Future plans:
Incorporporate Renko MACD strategy
Incorporate SOL-USD, DOGE-USD, ETH-USD
Add cost dollar averaging
Add take profits functionality
